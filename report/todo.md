we need to be careful in the second part of the paper around language of projects vs instances of CI as such
this is because we create a new entry for each CI type


- comments 
  - raitos of comments to line and code per config

future:
- proof read again and again (specailly with a fresh pair of eyes)
- conclusion and abstract need TLC
- introduction I don't think needs Fig 18 add to it 
  - I think that working over graphs and analysis with Stefan while proof reading should solve all the things



conclusion notes:
  we have reasoned about usage in terms of types of project (haven't done programmign language I dont think in this so far but do have the graph)



  agreed with past research in the area
    with the slight side note on subscirber
  
  ---------
  looked at usage of comments

  what kind of errors typically happen in terms of yaml for CI

  are scripts used more or less depending on the code count

  key take away - that a lot CI uses in built stuff and doesn't use comments
